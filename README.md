## Week 9 - Massachussetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) Real Time Bus Tracker
#### MIT xPRO Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN - January 2021

This repository was created to show my work for the coding assignment in week 9. This is a web app that tracks MBTA buses on a map.  

This project has the following features. 

* Allows users to select one or more MBTA routes that currently have vehicles on the route. 

* Periodically updates map with bus positions. 

* Shows the orientation of the bus along the route.
